	Simple way to create tests about any english text.
This project is a helpful assistant for English teachers. You can take any text or article and create a set of questions based in its content.
P.S.: This was just a school project, but still feel free to open Issues etc. I will try my best to help)
### Question types
- True/False Questions
- Multiple-Choice Questions
- Fill-in-the-Blank Questions
- Question with open answer 
### OpenAI API key
For usage, create a file key.py and put your key in text variable key.
By default it uses GPT4-Turbo.

P.P.S.: I never know why I name projects the way I do, usually it happens randomly. But, I think, this time, playing Cyberpunk not long before this project influened my decision ðŸ˜‰
Never Fade Away and bye Chooms!
